      <h3>Chicago, IL</h3>
      <section class="images">
        <img
          id="chicago-highrises"
          src="Chicago Highrises.jpg"
          alt="Chicago Highrises"
        />
        <img

      </section>
      <p>
        Chicago was surpisingly nice for such a metropolitan city. The
        architecture of the city had a great mix of old-fashioned buildings and
        more modern skyscrapers. The streets were bustling with busy
        businesspeople and local folks with INTERESTING conversations.

      <h3>Dallas, TX</h3>
      <section class="images">
        <img
          id="dallas-skyline"
          src="Dallas Skyline.jpg"
          alt="Dallas Skyline"
        />
        <img
          id="dallas-street"
          src="Dallas Grassy Knoll.jpg"
          alt="Dallas Grassy Knoll"
        />
      </section>
      <p>
        Dallas was a much bigger city than I expected. Despite not having many
        highrises, the city sprawls out over a massive area interconnected by an
        excellent infrastructure of highways. The heat was a massive surprise
        and bringing a couple of water bottles along anywhere is a must.

      <h3>Colarado Springs, CO</h3>
      <section class="images">
        <img id="colorado-peak" src="Pikes Peak.jpg" alt="Pike's Peak" />
        <img
          id="colorado-redrocks"

          alt="Garden of the Gods"
        />

      <p>
        Colorado is known for its high elevation and you can feel the effects of
        it immediately. Simply breathing noticable requires more physical effort
        and, like Dallas, constant hydration is a MUST. Colorado is home to some
        absolutely stunning mountain ranges, the biggest one being Pike's Peak,
        which is actually accessible by car.

    <div id="LA" style="display: none;">
      <h3>Los Angeles, CA</h3>
      <section class="images">
        <img id="la-palms" src="LA Palm Trees.jpg" alt="LA Palm Trees" />
        <img id="la-wof" src="Hollywood WoF.jpg" alt="Hollywood Walk of Fame" />
      </section>
      <p>
        Los Angeles was the stop that we spent the least time at, but even in
        that short period I could tell why so many people call it home. The
        lovely climate coupled with the beautiful scenery is bound to attract an
        ecclectic mix of individuals.
